# hello-world

Hello People! 

Dani Kop here, am on my way to get started with the endless possibilities that coding has to offer. Am wokring within the built environment, regret it. 

DO. 
NOT. 
GET. 
INTO. 
ARCHITECTURE.

Now, I am excited to create things in an unbuilt expanse. 
Yet, the tools architecture has to offer is rich in creativity and I shall see how my GitHub page morphs. 

Welp, with that aside, welcome to my page!
